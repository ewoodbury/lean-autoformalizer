# Executor Loop Architecture Overview

## 1. System Overview

The Executor Loop is the core engine of the lean-autoformalizer, transforming it from a basic decode-and-validate system into a sophisticated proof generation loop with intelligent error handling and iterative refinement capabilities. This system implements a complete autoformalization pipeline that compiles generated Lean code, analyzes compilation errors, and iteratively refines proofs until success or retry exhaustion.

## 2. Key Capabilities

### Core Features
- Error Classification: Parses Lean compiler stderr into five regex-backed categories and surfaces suggested fixes plus repair prompts
- Iterative Refinement: Configurable retry loop with beam/temperature schedules that now feed category-specific prompts into regeneration
- Practical Caching: Compilation results are cached to avoid recompilation; generation caching is available but still gathering data on hit rates  
- End-to-End Integration: Autoformalization returns detailed attempt logs, cached stats, and success flags consumable by demos and tests

### System Characteristics
- Modular Design: Separation across decoding, caching, error parsing, retry policy, and orchestration modules
- Error-Aware Retries: Repair prompts are constructed per category and passed into regeneration attempts after a failure
- Adaptive Retry Policy: Beam sizes and temperatures are scheduled per attempt with early exit on success
- Lightweight Caching: Compilation cache is in active use; generation/validation caches exist but are considered experimental until more telemetry is collected
- Detailed Logging: Generation attempts capture per-attempt parameters, candidate metadata, and aggregated cache stats

## 3. Architecture Components

### 3.1 Error Classification System

The error classification system provides intelligent parsing and categorization of Lean compilation errors:

**Error Categories**:
- E1: Unknown Identifier/Missing Import
  - Pattern: `unknown identifier 'X'`, `failed to resolve 'Y'`
  - Repair Strategy: Suggest imports, check spelling variations
  
- E2: Type Mismatch
  - Pattern: `type mismatch`, `expected X, got Y`
  - Repair Strategy: Type-aware tactic suggestions, coercion hints
  
- E3: Tactic Failed/Goal Mismatch
  - Pattern: `tactic failed`, `unsolved goals`, `goal state:`
  - Repair Strategy: Alternative tactic suggestions, goal decomposition
  
- E4: Missing Premise/Lemma Not Found
  - Pattern: `could not synthesize`, `no applicable rules`
  - Repair Strategy: Premise suggestions, alternative lemma names
  
- E5: Syntax/Indentation
  - Pattern: `unexpected token`, `expected ')'`, indentation errors
  - Repair Strategy: Syntax fixing, bracket balancing

**Architecture**:
```python
@dataclass
class LeanError:
    category: ErrorCategory
    message: str
    line_number: int | None
    severity: ErrorSeverity
    suggested_fixes: list[str]
    original_stderr: str

class ErrorClassifier:
    def classify_errors(self, stderr: str) -> list[LeanError]:
        """Parse stderr and return classified errors with fix suggestions."""
        
    def get_primary_error(self, errors: list[LeanError]) -> LeanError | None:
        """Get the most important error for repair focus."""
        
def generate_repair_prompt(error: LeanError, original_code: str) -> str:
    """Generate specialized repair prompt for error category."""
```

### 3.2 Retry Policy and Beam Search

The retry system implements adaptive exploration with configurable beam search:

**Retry Strategy**:
- Attempt 1: Single candidate, temperature=0.3 (focused)
- Attempt 2-3: Beam size 3, temperature=0.5 (moderate exploration)
- Attempt 4-5: Beam size 5, temperature=0.7 (high exploration)
- Early termination on success or max attempts reached

**Architecture**:
```python
@dataclass
class RetryConfig:
    max_attempts: int = 5
    beam_schedule: list[int] = field(default_factory=lambda: [1, 3, 3, 5, 5])
    temperature_schedule: list[float] = field(default_factory=lambda: [0.3, 0.5, 0.5, 0.7, 0.7])
    max_tokens: int = 512

class BeamSearchExecutor:
    def generate_candidates(self, item: dict, error_context: LeanError | None, 
                          beam_size: int, temperature: float) -> list[CandidateLean]:
        """Generate multiple candidates using beam search."""

class RetryPolicyExecutor:
    def execute_with_retries(self, item: dict, config: RetryConfig, 
                           compile_fn) -> tuple[list[CandidateLean], int, float, list[LeanError]]:
        """Execute retry policy with beam search and error recovery."""
```

### 3.3 Caching System

The multi-level caching system optimizes performance by avoiding redundant operations:

**Cache Levels**:
1. Compilation Cache: `lean_code_hash -> CompileResult`
2. Generation Cache: `(prompt_hash, model_params) -> list[CandidateLean]`
3. Validation Cache: `code_hash -> (is_valid, errors)`

**Architecture**:
```python
@dataclass 
class CacheStats:
    compile_hits: int = 0
    compile_misses: int = 0
    generation_hits: int = 0
    generation_misses: int = 0
    validation_hits: int = 0
    validation_misses: int = 0

class ExecutorCache:
    def __init__(self, max_compile_cache: int = 1000, 
                 max_generation_cache: int = 1000,
                 max_validation_cache: int = 500):
        """Multi-level cache with LRU eviction."""
        
    def get_compile_result(self, lean_code: str) -> CompileResult | None:
    def cache_compile_result(self, lean_code: str, result: CompileResult) -> None:
    def get_generation_result(self, prompt: str, **params) -> list[CandidateLean] | None:
    def cache_generation_result(self, prompt: str, result: list[CandidateLean], **params) -> None:
    def get_cache_info(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """Comprehensive cache statistics and hit rates."""
```

### 3.4 Main Execution Loop

The core autoformalization loop orchestrates all components for end-to-end proof generation:

**Architecture**:
```python
@dataclass
class AutoformalizationResult:
    success: bool
    final_code: str | None
    attempts: int
    total_time: float
    errors_encountered: list[LeanError]
    generation_log: list[dict]
    cache_info: dict[str, Any]

class AutoformalizationExecutor:
    def __init__(self, model_client: ModelClient, 
                 cache: ExecutorCache | None = None,
                 config: RetryConfig | None = None):
        """Main executor orchestrating all components."""
        
    def autoformalize(self, item: dict, 
                     config: RetryConfig | None = None) -> AutoformalizationResult:
        """Main autoformalization loop with comprehensive error handling."""
        
    def compile_with_cache(self, lean_code: str) -> tuple[bool, str]:
        """Compile Lean code with caching optimization."""
        
    def get_cache_stats(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """Get current cache performance statistics."""

# Convenience function for simple usage
def autoformalize_item(item: dict, model_client: ModelClient, **kwargs) -> AutoformalizationResult:
    """Simplified interface for single-item autoformalization."""
```

## 4. Module Structure

### 4.1 Package Organization

The executor system is organized as a structured package with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/autoformalizer/executor/
├── __init__.py          # Public API exports and convenience functions
├── lean.py             # Lean compilation utilities and CompileResult handling
├── errors.py           # Error classification, parsing, and repair prompt generation
├── loop.py             # Main execution loop, AutoformalizationExecutor, and result handling
├── cache.py            # Multi-level caching with LRU eviction and performance tracking
└── beam.py             # Beam search, retry policies, and candidate generation
```

### 4.2 Component Interactions

The modules interact in a layered architecture:

**Execution Flow**:
1. loop.py orchestrates the overall autoformalization process
2. beam.py handles retry policy and candidate generation
3. cache.py optimizes performance by avoiding redundant operations
4. errors.py analyzes compilation failures and generates repair prompts
5. lean.py provides low-level Lean compilation functionality

**Dependency Graph**:
- `loop.py` → `beam.py`, `cache.py`, `errors.py`, `lean.py`
- `beam.py` → `cache.py`, `errors.py`
- `errors.py` → Independent (core classification logic)
- `cache.py` → Independent (performance optimization)
- `lean.py` → Independent (Lean interface)

### 4.3 Error Repair Prompt System

The system uses specialized prompt templates for each error category:
```python
REPAIR_PROMPTS = {
    ErrorCategory.UNKNOWN_IDENTIFIER: """
The Lean compiler couldn't find '{identifier}'. This usually means:
1. Missing import statement
2. Typo in identifier name
3. Wrong namespace

Original code:
{original_code}

Error: {error_message}

Fix the code by adding the correct import or fixing the identifier:
""",

    ErrorCategory.TYPE_MISMATCH: """
There's a type mismatch in your Lean code. The compiler expected one type but got another.

Original code:
{original_code}

Error: {error_message}

Fix the type mismatch by adjusting the proof or using appropriate coercions:
""",

    ErrorCategory.TACTIC_FAILED: """
The tactic in your proof failed to solve the goal.

Original code:
{original_code}

Error: {error_message}

Try a different tactic or break down the proof into smaller steps:
""",

    ErrorCategory.MISSING_PREMISE: """
The proof requires a lemma or premise that couldn't be found or synthesized.

Original code:
{original_code}

Error: {error_message}

Add the missing premise or use a different approach:
""",

    ErrorCategory.SYNTAX_ERROR: """
There's a syntax error in your Lean code.

Original code:
{original_code}

Error: {error_message}

Fix the syntax error:
"""
}
```

## 5. Validation Status

- **Unit coverage**: `tests/executor` (83 tests) exercise retry policies, caching behaviour, result serialization, and the convenience wrapper. `tests/decode` (36 tests) cover prompt construction, candidate validation, and error handling in the decoder. Error classification and cache utilities each have focused suites.
- **Integration coverage**: Current integration tests rely on mocked model and compilation layers (`TestExecutorIntegration` / `demo_phase3.py`) to simulate multi-attempt flows. A dataset-driven smoke test with a real model client is still outstanding.
- **Manual demos**: `scripts/demo_phase3.py` walks through error classification, caching, retry configuration, and the main execution loop with mocked responses for quick inspection.

### Known gaps in validation

- Automated evaluation on the `dev` split has not yet been implemented, so the roadmap criterion of "10 dev items with at least one success" remains unverified.
- Generation and validation cache telemetry is minimal; hit rates will need measurement once hooked up to real workloads.
- Multi-line Lean error messages are currently flattened line-by-line, so repair prompts may omit broader goal context.

## 6. Operational Notes

- Compile caching provides the largest savings today; repair prompts now flow into successive generations but remain template-based.
- Generation retries still operate against mocked LLM interfaces in tests. When integrating a real client, ensure that the prompt override pathway is respected and that seeds/temperature schedules map cleanly to the provider API.
- Before productizing, add lightweight metrics around attempt counts, cache effectiveness, and error distributions so future documentation can cite measured behaviour instead of assumptions.

## 7. Design Decisions and Trade-offs

### 7.1 Architectural Choices

**Modular Package Structure**:
- Decision: Split monolithic `executor.py` into 5 specialized modules
- Rationale: Improves maintainability, testability, and enables independent development
- Trade-off: Increased complexity vs. better separation of concerns

**Caching Strategy**:
- Decision: Add compilation caching (actively used) alongside generation/validation caches that can be enabled when telemetry demands it
- Rationale: Compilation remains the dominant cost, making caching a low-risk win; additional layers are ready for future tuning
- Trade-off: Storing extra cache layers increases complexity without clear benefit until real hit-rate data is collected

**Error-Specific Repair Prompts**:
- Decision: 5-category error taxonomy with specialized repair strategies
- Rationale: Targeted fixes are more effective than generic retry attempts
- Trade-off: Implementation complexity vs. repair effectiveness

### 7.2 Reliability and Robustness

**Retry Policy Design**:
- Hard Limits: Maximum 5 attempts prevents infinite loops
- Adaptive Exploration: Increasing beam size and temperature across attempts
- Circuit Breakers: Exception handling with graceful degradation

**Cache Safety**:
- Hash-Based Keys: Cryptographic hashing ensures cache correctness
- LRU Eviction: Prevents unbounded memory growth
- Conservative Design: Fails open (cache miss) rather than returning stale data

**Error Recovery**:
- Comprehensive Logging: All failures captured with full context for debugging
- Graceful Degradation: System continues operating even with partial failures
- Validation: All inputs and outputs validated at module boundaries

## 8. API and Usage
