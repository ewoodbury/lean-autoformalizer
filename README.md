# lean-autoformalizer

Minimal autoformalization pipeline of simple math proofs from English into Lean 4 (with Mathlib). 

## Prerequisites
- [Lean 4 toolchain](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html) (Lake 5+, compatible with `leanprover/lean4:v4.18.0`).
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) â‰¥ 0.8 for Python dependency management.

## Lean environment
```bash
# Fetch mathlib and build the sample project targets
make build-lean

# Or run the helper script to confirm the environment is functional
make check-lean
```
The helper script runs `lake build Autoformalizer.Basic` followed by `lake build` to confirm that mathlib is available and the scaffolding compiles.

## Python environment
```bash
# Create a local virtualenv at .venv and install runtime+dev deps
./scripts/bootstrap_python.sh
```
After the sync you can invoke tooling with `uv run`:
```bash
uv run --python 3.11 --group dev ruff check
uv run --python 3.11 pytest
```

## Executor sanity check
```bash
uv run python - <<'PY'
from autoformalizer.executor import run_proof

snippet = """
    theorem tmp (a b : Nat) : a + b = b + a := by
      simpa using Nat.add_comm a b
"""
print(run_proof(snippet))
PY
```
The call returns `(True, "")` when Lean accepts the generated snippet. Failures return `False` and emit compiler stderr for downstream prompt repair.

## CLI entrypoint
```bash
uv run autoformalize check Autoformalizer/Basic.lean
```
This wraps `run_proof` so Phase 0 can be driven from the command line.

### Talking to an LLM (OpenRouter)

Set your OpenRouter key in the environment and invoke the new `decode` command to translate
English statements into Lean code through `x-ai/grok-4-fast`:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
uv run autoformalize decode \
  --statement "For all natural numbers n, n + 0 = n" \
  --step "Use Nat.add_zero"
```

Flags you may find useful:

- `--model`: override the OpenRouter model (defaults to `x-ai/grok-4-fast`).
- `--max-tokens` / `--temperature`: control sampling parameters.
- `--show-prompt`: print the exact prompt sent to the model.
- `--output`: save the generated Lean snippet to a file.
- `--step`: optionally provide one or more proof hints (separate multiple steps with `;`).

The command validates the returned code with lightweight structural checks before printing the
result, so you immediately learn whether the snippet is syntactically plausible.

## Linting & formatting
`ruff` is configured as the single source of truth for linting and formatting. Use:
```bash
make lint
make format
```

## Next steps
- Flesh out the dataset scaffolding (`datasets/`) and prompt templates.
- Extend the executor to manage temporary modules and compile caching.
- Add CI and Docker wiring once the baseline pipeline is in place.
